An index of open source software, descriptions, and offers for personal mentorship for the Computer Science students at the University of Havana.

## Please Contribute

With your help, I hope transfer, categorize and index ~2GBs of open source software into this Github repository for the students of the Computer Science department at the University of Havana. If you're willing to help here's what we might do:

+ Help me propose a reasoning and folder structure for this index. Given their hardware is likely a few generations behind, which operating systems are worth using? Which Tor clients are reliable? NodeSchool corpuses are needed to advance? Assume that there is no prior developmental knowledge and work from there.

+ Not just providing the files, but for each, provide instruction or clarification to the student as to why this package / tarball / might be important. Give context to what it replaces, as if your tech stack and hardware was stuck somewhere in the late 90s, at best.

+ Put your name / handles in that instructional file, and offer assistance if someone wants to learn more about a specific language or technology. Link to repos or packages that you might have authored, and offer mentorship going forward.

+ Please no pirated software, propaganda or viruses. Letâ€™s use this as an offering of goodwill, not a political platform.
