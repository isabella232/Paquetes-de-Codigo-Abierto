[NODESCHOOL WORKSHOPS](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers)


You’ll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) on your computer to get started with each of these. Then use [npm](http://npmjs.com/) (it comes with Node) to install each module with the command below it. Once installed, simply type the workshopper’s name to launch.

You will also need a Text Editor, if you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code. A few options: [Atom](http://atom.io), [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com), or [Textmate](https://macromates.com/).
